# Raw data

In this README, describe how the raw data was obtained, and other any information necessary to understand the provenance and meaning of the data.

[Read more at the GSLab RA Manual](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/Data#raw-data).

This folder is gitignored in the readme-template repository, by default, so that collaborators can copy-paste potentially large or sensitive data in and not have it be pushed or pulled from the repo. 

If you want to include real data in the repository, then remove that line from the [gitignore file](../../.gitignore). For very large datasets, consider [Git LFS](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/Data#storage).
